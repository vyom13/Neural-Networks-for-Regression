# Neural Networks for Regression in Python
Implement your own neural network for regression purpose in Python. Use the mean squared error as the cost function.  

The neural network has two input units (not counting the bias unit), one hidden layer with two units (not counting the bias unit), and two output units.  Assume that there is only one sample being

**x=[0.05, 0.1]  
y=[0.01, 0.99]**  

Initialize values in Θ(1) and Θ(2) to be uniformly distributed random numbers between 0.0 and 1.0.  

Implement your algorithm based on the theory presented in class.  Plot the total cost vsthe iterations as well as every parameter θ vs the iterations.
